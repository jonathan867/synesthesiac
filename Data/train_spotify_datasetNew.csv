My temple ran quick though From the thought, then the worst: I was caught in the same place A year later. For me, that’s when hatred started My faith martyred. I’ve dated the father of a father Then I moved on. Years passed, the guilt’s Worse and it builds ‘til your heart’s smashed Then I miscarried. Twenty-two age, I was headed to A breakdown, swallowed up some pills and I laid down I was a failure at that too, bailed from The rap then, but fate took me back in “Sing” is a tattoo my fingers attached with.

Well take me, Hell To the depths where the brimstone chokes me constantly I am a monster, see. How could I possibly Correspond with God when I gave the authority To end their life? But it’s never over, even if we have a child They could have had a brother or a sister or both I’m thinking about another life that almost got close Praying that, in another time, we could have changed posts If I could just reverse time, I would I don’t know what I would do.

When we went back to our tables we were trying not to look over at each other and told our friends to stop staring. I didn't see her for the rest of the night, but by closing time the beer's kicked in so I go up and speak to her and we end up going for a walk, and talking about our new homes, our new jobs, our new friends, and our new birds She said she'd been going out with him now for about two and a half years, but they don't live together so he'd never find out. And you think about chasing her about school when you were wee and lying in your bed and listening to love songs and pretending they were about you. And the first time you asked her out she said no but one night you went to a wedding and when you came back to the pub she'd changed her mind and you went out. You remember the way she swung her arms when she held your hand but you can't remember how she kissed and now you've got the chance to find out But you have to remember there's this other kiss and she's sittin' at home wondering where you are and what you're doing. And you worked hard on this kiss and you know it inside out; it's as much yours as it is hers, and it took a long time to get right, it took months of practice and months of embarrassment, but now you've got it perfected and you've been looking forward to that kiss all week You can see her breath in the air between your faces, as you stand in the leaves and she just asks you straight out if you want to come and stay at her flat. But you make sure you get separate taxis and you go home and there might be a slight regret and maybe you'll wonder what you missed, but you have to remember the kiss that you worked so hard on.
